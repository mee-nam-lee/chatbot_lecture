# Chat Custom Web App Readme (v. 18.2.3.0)

This chat allows you to host your bot on any website. You can also customize the look and feel of this widget.
## Requirements
- NodeJS ([https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/))
## Bots SDK configuration
### Generate the App ID
1. In your Oracle Intelligent Bots instance, open your bot, choose **Settings** in the left navbar, and then choose **Channels**.
1. Click **Add Channel** and then complete the dialog, choosing **Web** as the channel type. After you complete this dialog, Bots will generate the App Id that you need to initialize the Bots SDK. Keep it close at hand.
### Bots SDK
This sample app already has the Bots Client SDK for JavaScript included in the project. This SDK is compiled for the localhost environment only.
To use the SDK in another location, download it and  follow the readme file to compile it on your server.

### Configuration file
Required parameters for the SDK:
```json
{
  "mode": "botsSDK",
  "appId": "APPLICATION_ID",
  "sdkUrl": "SDK_FOLDER_URL"
}
```
